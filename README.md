# UniEats

This project contains code used in a project for my "Designing for Real People" module during my degree.\
In this project I created an app which allows students to order food from restaurants on campus and in the local area as well as deliver food that other students have ordered inside the app.\\

The front end was developed using react native with the expo framework and the back end used Django with the REST API
